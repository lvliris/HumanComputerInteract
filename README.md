# Human Computer Interact
Detect the key points of human body by Kinect and use the data to control computer  
1. use the skeleton key points to estimate body guesture to determine the controller, enter control mode, leave control mode  
2. use the position of hands to move the mouse on the screen  
3. detect the guesture of hands to perform click and drag action  
4. use a "hanging select" mode to overcome the changing position of hands while switch hand guesture  

The software is developed on the basis of Microsoft Kinect SDK V2
